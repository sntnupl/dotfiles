" When you paste text into your terminal-based Vim with a right mouse click, Vim cannot know it is
" coming from a paste. To Vim, it looks like text entered by someone who can
" type incredibly fast.
" Since Vim thinks this is regular key strokes, it applies all
" auto-indenting and auto-expansion
" of defined abbreviations to the input, resulting in often cascading
" indents of paragraphs.
" The following allows us to temporarily switch to 'paste mode'. F2 becomes a toggle switch.

" Movement
" In visual mode, once u indent code, the visual mode goes away and normal
" mode comes back. This might not be what you want, in that case, the
" following key mapping changes would help. This is basically going to allow
" Visual mode to stay post indentation. For the record, >gv  means
" 1. shift text right (>)
" 2. reselect it (g)
" 3. go back to visual mode (v)
:vmap > >gv
:vmap < <gv
" Putting <Tab> to better use..
" 1. Use Tab and Shift-Tab to indent right/left. Note: only in Visual Mode.
:vmap <Tab> >gv
:vmap <S-Tab> <gv
